# Fear, volatility and the new normal of the german Day-Ahead-Auction
## An analysis of prices in 2023, 2022 and the time before

The last two years on European power markets have been like no other. A war in Ukraine, the ongoing energy revolution with increasing renewables feed-in, unstable weather conditions and switching off nuclear power plants are just some of the upheavals in European electricity markets. With this analysis I want to take a deeper look at the prices of the German Day-Ahead-Auction. This analysis neither claims to be complete nor extensive in tracking all price-influencing events but it tries to give some statistical insight on how the price level changed over time.
