# Fear, volatility and the new normal of the german Day-Ahead-Auction
## An analysis of prices in 2023, 2022 and the time before

The last two years have been like no other in Europe's electricity markets. A war in Ukraine, the ongoing energy revolution with increasing renewable energy feed-in, unstable weather conditions and the shutdown of nuclear power plants are just some of the upheavals in European power markets. In this analysis, I would like to take a closer look at the German Day-Ahead-Auction prices. This analysis does not claim to be complete or comprehensive in tracking all price-influencing events, but it does try to give some statistical insight into how the price level has changed over time.

#### Price levels

In the following visualisations, I have analysed data from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2023. First, to get an understanding of the general long-term price level, the German Day-Ahead-Auction Price is plotted. For this graph, the daily average price has been calculated to smooth out the daily price fluctuations, which can be caused by hour-specific demand, renewable production, or other fundamental price drivers.
