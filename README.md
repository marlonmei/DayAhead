# Fear, volatility and the new normal of the german Day-Ahead-Auction
## An analysis of prices in 2023, 2022 and the time before

The last two years on European power markets have been like no other. A war in Ukraine, the ongoing energy revolution with increasing renewables feed-in, unstable weather conditions and switching off nuclear power plants are just some of the upheavals in European electricity markets. With this analysis I want to take a deeper look at the prices of the German Day-Ahead-Auction. This analysis neither claims to be complete nor extensive in tracking all price-influencing events but it tries to give some statistical insight on how the price level changed over time.

In 2020 the price level was with approx. 30 EUR/MWh relatively stable throughout the whole year. Yet, due to the pandemic and the consequently decrease of especially industrial and commercial electricity consumption prices went down in the beginning of spring. After prices slowly recovered to pre-pandemic levels, they finally increased quickly at the end of 2021. This was mainly driven by increasing demands of electricity due to a quick economic recovery after loosening pandemic regulations. At this stage prices already tripled in comparison to the pre-pandemic level. 
In 2022 power markets finally went crazy. In February Russia invaded Ukraine which since then resulted in an ongoing war between these nations and heavily impacted global energy markets. During this time Russia was with approx. 40 % of German natural gas imports the most important natural gas supplier . With the beginning of the war in Europe the supply wasnâ€™t guaranteed and by time also not wanted anymore. In 2022 gas power plants were responsible for approx. 10% of electricity production , thus why the commodity price heavily affected power markets as well. The maximum auction price of 2022 of 871 EUR/MWh was reached on the 29 August. This is more than a 7-fold increase to the maximum price of 2019. After another price peak at the end of 2022, it seems like prices have normalized again in 2023. Nevertheless, with an average of approximately 100 EUR/MWh the price level is significantly higher than during the pandemic or the time before.
Looking at these price developments especially the price volatility in 2022 is noteworthy. Accordingly, I calculated some measures of dispersion to quantify the volatility. In the image XXX the daily spread between the maximum and minimum price is visualized. It shows that during the 24 hours of a day the price range used to be approximately between 30-50 EUR/MWh. Similar as the overall price level this value increased heavily in 2022, such as spreads from 300 to 400 EUR/MWh have occurred on a regular basis. Spreads during the day are particularly interesting for flexibility providers like battery storage operators. These providers can make use of price spreads for arbitrage trades.
